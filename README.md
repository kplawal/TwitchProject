# TwitchProject
Twitch is the world’s leading video platform and community where millions of people and thousands of interests collide in a beautiful explosion
of video games, pop culture, and conversation. Its live and on-demand video platform forms the backbone of a distribution network for video game broadcasters 
including professional players, tournaments, leagues, developers and gaming media organizations.
In this project, we have partnered with Twitch’s Science Team and  will be working with two training tables that 
contain Twitch users’ stream viewing data and chat room usage data.
The project is broken down into two parts: Analyze Data with SQL and Visualize Data with Matplotlib
